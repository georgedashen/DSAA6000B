Author: Zhuoyang CHEN

Most part of codes are borrowed from [Tang, Jianheng, et al. "Rethinking graph neural networks for anomaly detection." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2022.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15508)

The GCN models are directly constructed using `GCNConv` Module of pytorch version. Detail implementation can be checked at Thomas Kipf, [Graph Convolutional Networks](http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/) (2016)
